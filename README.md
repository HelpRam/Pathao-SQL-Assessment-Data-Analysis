## üõ† **Overview**  
The Pathao SQL Assessment is designed to test the ability to analyze data, solve problems, and generate reports using SQL. This repository includes:  
- Structured queries to extract, filter, and manipulate data.  
- Analytical insights drawn from the dataset.  
- SQL code that is optimized and easy to read.  

---

## üéØ **Key Objectives**  
- Analyze business-related metrics like user activity, revenue generation, and operational performance.  
- Solve specific analytical problems posed in the assessment.  
- Demonstrate SQL skills, including JOINs, GROUP BY, subqueries, and window functions.  
- Create insights that could help improve business decision-making.

## üìÇ **Dataset Description**  
The assessment dataset contains tables relevant to Pathao‚Äôs business operations. Example tables might include:  
- **Users**: User profiles and registration information.  
- **Rides**: Ride details, including trip status, duration, and revenue.  
- **Transactions**: Financial data, including payments and refunds.  
- **Driver Data**: Information about drivers and their performance.  

> **Note**: The dataset specifics depend on the problem statement provided in the assessment.

## üîç **SQL Queries and Insights**  
Some key queries and their objectives include:  
1. **User Analysis**:  
   - Identified active users based on their ride history.  
   - Found the percentage of new vs returning users.  

2. **Revenue Analysis**:  
   - Calculated total revenue generated over a period.  
   - Analyzed revenue per ride and top-performing regions.  

3. **Driver Performance**:  
   - Evaluated driver ratings and completed ride counts.  
   - Highlighted the most efficient drivers based on trip data.  

4. **Operational Insights**:  
   - Examined peak hours for ride requests.  
   - Analyzed cancellation rates and identified improvement areas.

## üõ† **Tools and Technologies**  
- **SQL**:  
  - Queries were written and tested in PostgreSQL/MySQL (as per requirements).  
- **Jupyter Notebook (Optional)**:  
  - Used for combining SQL queries with Python for visualization and reporting.  
- **Excel/Google Sheets (Optional)**:  
  - For summarizing results into readable reports.

## üöÄ **How to Use**  
1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/HelpRam/Pathao-SQL-Assessment-Data-Analysis.git
   cd Pathao-SQL-Assessment  
   ```  

2. **Set Up the Database**:  
   - Import the dataset SQL dump into your local SQL server:  
     ```bash  
     mysql -u username -p database_name < dataset.sql  
     ```  

3. **Run the Queries**:  
   - Execute SQL queries in the provided `.sql` file to generate results.  

4. **Optional**:  
   - Use Python scripts or Excel files to visualize the data and create reports.
